            <span>SafeMoon Protocol WhitePaper</span>
            <p>A common misconception with the heavy APY average is the subjectivity of
                the impermanent loss from staking an LP
                (liquidity provider) in a farming reward generator. With the explosion of DeFi we have seen too many new
                cryptocurrency
                prospectors get sucked into a high APY LP-farming trap, feeling hopeless as they are pushed out by
                earlier buyers with
                higher staking rewards. We’ve all been there, seeing those shiny 6 digit figures can be pretty damn
                tempting to jump in.</p>
            <p class="marginbottom">However, almost always the token suffers from the inevitable valuation bubble, which
                is then
                followed by
                the burst and
                the impending collapse of the price. This is why we have seen the mass adoption of static rewards, also
                known as
                reflection, a separate concept that seeks to eliminate the troubles caused by farming rewards.</p>
            <span>Why Static?</span>
            <p class="marginbottom">Static rewards solve a host of problems. First, the reward amount is conditional
                upon
                the volume of the token being
                traded. This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token caused by
                earlier adopters
                selling their tokens after farming crazy high APY’s. Second, the reflect mechanism encourages holders to
                hang onto their
                tokens to garner higher kick-backs which are based upon a percentages carried out and dependant upon the
                total tokens
                held by the owner.</p>
            <span>Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP)</span>
            <p>Automatic LP is the secret sauce of SAFEMOON. Here we have a function
                that acts as a two-fold beneficial implementation for holders.</p>
            <p>
                First, the contract sucks up tokens from sellers and buyers alike, and adds them to the LP creating a
                solid price floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, the penalty acts as an arbitrage resistant mechanism that secures the volume of SAFEMOON as a
                reward for the
                holders. In theory, the added LP creates a stability from the supplied LP by adding the tax to the
                overall liquidity of
                the token, thus increasing the tokens overall LP and supporting the price floor of the token. This is
                different from the
                burn function of other reflection tokens which is only beneficial in the short term from the granted
                reduction of
                supply.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the SAFEMOON token LP increases, the price stability mirrors this function with the benefit of a
                solid price floor
                and cushion for holders. The goal here is to prevent the larger dips when whales decide to sell their
                tokens later in
                the game, which keeps the price from fluctuating as much as if there was no automatic LP function.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this is an effort to alleviate some of the troubles we have seen with the current DeFi reflection
                tokens. We are
                confident that this model and protocol will prevail over the outdated reflection tokens for these
                reasons.
